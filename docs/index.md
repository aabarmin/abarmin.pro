# Aleksandr Barmin: One Stop Page

I'm passionate about building software users love and businesses value. I'm passionate about working in product teams, where we deliver real value directly to customers.

## Today

I'm senior engineer at [Wise](https://wise.com) in the core transaction clearing and processing team. 

## Experience

I've been in software engineering for the past 15 years, building software for companies like Aeroflot, Thomson Reuters, Santander, and Wise.

My experience spans everything from small front-ends using Next.js and React, to Java monoliths, enterprise-grade content management systems, and highly scalable microservice-based applications.

I've also developed a number of internal tools to help teams ship faster, established CI/CD pipelines, and helped grow engineering practices from the ground up.
